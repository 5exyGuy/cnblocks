# HeroThree Normal Block

## Description
A modern, responsive hero section component featuring a clean navigation header, centered hero content with an email subscription form, and decorative gradient background effects. The component includes a unique floating logo design and a responsive mobile menu.

## File Path
`$lib/components/blocks/hero/hero-three.svelte`

## Dependencies
- **Shadcn Svelte**: Button component from `$lib/components/ui/button/button.svelte`
- **Lucide Svelte**: Icons from `@lucide/svelte`
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility classes via `$lib/utils` (cn helper)
- **Svelte Reactivity**: scrollY from `svelte/reactivity/window` for scroll-based effects

## Snippets

### heroheader
A snippet defining a responsive navigation bar with a logo, menu items, and buttons. It includes a toggleable mobile menu (visible on small screens) and changes appearance when scrolled (isScrolled). Used via `{@render heroheader()}` in the component's markup.

## State

### menuState
`$state(false)` - A reactive boolean controlling the mobile menu's open/closed state. Toggled via a button with `onclick={() => (menuState = !menuState)}`.

## Derived State

### isScrolled
`$derived.by(() => scrollY.current !== undefined && scrollY.current > 50)` - A boolean that returns true when the page is scrolled past 50 pixels, triggering a smaller, blurred navbar with a border.

## Usage
Import the HeroThree component from the blocks directory and add it to your Svelte page. Ensure Shadcn Svelte, Lucide Svelte, and Tailwind CSS are configured in your project.

### Example
```svelte
<script>
  import HeroThree from "$lib/components/blocks/hero/hero-three.svelte";
</script>

<HeroThree />
```

## Styling
Uses Tailwind CSS classes:

- **Navigation**: `fixed`, `z-20`, `bg-background/50`, `backdrop-blur-lg` (when scrolled), `rounded-2xl`
- **Hero**: `bg-gradient-to-r`, `from-blue-600`, `to-purple-600` (via var(--color-background)), `text-white`, `py-24`, `text-center`
- **Form**: `flex`, `gap-2`, `items-center`, `justify-center`

## Notes
- **Responsive**: Mobile menu toggles on small screens; form adjusts to full width on mobile
- **Animations**: Scroll-based navbar transitions and floating logo effects
- **Features**:
  - Email subscription form with icon
  - Unique gradient background effects with radial patterns
  - Floating logo design
  - Dark mode support
  - Custom SVG logo implementation with opacity effects
